# EE-Scenario-snippets
Minimal examples of Empty Epsilon missions to demonstrate just one functionality in as little code as possible and libraries with specific functions extracted from complex scenarios. 
I try to describe what is done where, so expect more comments than usual. 

For seasoned Empty Epsilon mission creators: Pull requests are welcome, suggestions what to do here are also welcome.
